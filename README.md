## 🎨 Design & UX Choices

### **1. Color Palette & Typography**
- **Colors**:
  - **Primary**: `#4CAF50` (Gnome Green) – Evokes nature and garden themes.
  - **Secondary**: `#FF9800` (Sunset Orange) – Adds warmth and contrast.
  - **Accent**: `#795548` (Wood Brown) – Complements the earthy, outdoor vibe.
  - **Why?**: These colors create a **playful yet natural** atmosphere, aligning with the garden theme while ensuring readability.

### **2. Layout & Responsiveness**
- **Grid System**:
  - **Desktop**: 4-column grid for product cards.
  - **Tablet**: 2-column grid.
  - **Mobile**: Single-column stack.
  - **Why?**: Ensures **consistent spacing** and **easy navigation** across devices.

- **Modal Design**:
  - Clean white background with subtle shadows.
  - Close button (×) in the top-right corner.
  - **Why?**: Follows **standard UX patterns** for modals, making it intuitive for users.

### **3. Interactive Elements**
- **Hover Effects**:
  - Product cards scale slightly (`transform: scale(1.05)`) on hover.
  - Buttons change color (`#45a049` on hover).
  - **Why?**: Provides **visual feedback** to users, improving engagement.

- **Tooltips**:
  - Appear on hover over attribute icons (resistance/rarity).
  - **Why?**: Reduces clutter while keeping **essential info accessible**.

### **4. Accessibility**
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of `<h1>-<h6>`, `<button>`, and `<alt>` tags.
- **Contrast**: Text/background contrast meets WCAG standards.
